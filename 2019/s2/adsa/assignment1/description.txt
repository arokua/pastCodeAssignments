This C++ program performs arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on very large integers using strings.
It works with numbers in bases from 2 to 10. Here's the breakdown:
1.	String-Based Arithmetic:
	Numbers are stored as strings to handle large values.
	Addition and subtraction are done digit by digit, accounting for base-specific carry or borrow.
	Multiplication uses the Karatsuba algorithm, which is faster for large numbers than traditional methods.
2.	Karatsuba Multiplication:
	This divide-and-conquer approach splits numbers, performs smaller multiplications, and combines the results. It reduces multiplication time complexity.
3.	String Division:
	Division is implemented using long division, similar to manual calculations, handling string-based numbers.
4.	Base Conversion:
  The program can convert numbers between base 10 and any base from 2 to 10, allowing operations across different bases.
5.	Input and Output:
 Takes two large numbers and a base as input, performs addition, multiplication (Karatsuba), and division, and outputs the results.
